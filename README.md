ChatSQL is a simple chat application that uses LLM models to generate a SQL query based on a natural language query and a database schema.

This application was developed as part of the [SC01103936: Software Engineering](https://en.didattica.unipd.it/off/2021/LT/SC/SC1167/000ZZ/SC01103936) course at the University of Padua and was proposed by _Zucchetti S.p.A._ .

## Project proposal

The project proposal can be found [here](https://www.math.unipd.it/~tullio/IS-1/2023/Progetto/C9.pdf) (in Italian).

This project endeavors to create a chat application that employs LLM models to produce a SQL query derived from a natural language query and a database schema.
